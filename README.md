# dotfiles

This is my dotfiles, managed with [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) as described in [this blog post](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).

Install them all by running `install.sh`, or install individual pieces of software with `stow <dirname>`.
